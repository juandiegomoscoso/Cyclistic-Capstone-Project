## Backgroud

### About Cyclistic:
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. 

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The director of marketing, Lily Moreno, believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. 

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. 

As a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, under the direction of Moreno, my role is to analyze Cyclistic historic bike trip data to spot trends and make insight about how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
